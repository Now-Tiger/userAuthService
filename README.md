# User Authentication Service.

## Project Outline

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ This project is a detailed guide on how to set up user authentication using cookies and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a Node.js application. It also explores the use of Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database. The project goes through the process of setting up a database, populating it with seeded data, and then creating routes and controllers for user authentication. The authentication process involves logging in, accessing user details, and logging out, all using JWT for session management and cookies for storing the JWT on the client side.
